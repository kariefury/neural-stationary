Initial setup of project. 


```
pip install nengo
```

Then move to a shell and navigate to the git folder for the project.
```
nengo
```

Wait until Nengo opens a web browser. Once the browser is open, click on recurrent_inhibit.py file in the file navigator on the left hand side.

Comment or uncomment code in the file editor and press the simulate button to see how it works.

Or, open a python interpeter (I use pyCharm) and open experiment_outline.py. Press Build and Run to create new png files for 3 new plots based on experiment_outline.py
